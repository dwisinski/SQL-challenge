## Project: SQL Homework

## Description:
This project was created to demonstrate a number of data engineering and data analysis concepts using a fictitious data set of company and employee data. Data was imported into SQL tables from .csv format and analyzed using various basic SQL queries. All work was performed using PostgreSQL.

A basic Entity Relationship Diagram was created detailing all relevant structure, tables, and relationships.

## **Important Notes:**
Source data is located in the EmployeeSQL folder. Database schema/setup is located in the schema.sql file and all database queries are located in the queries.sql file. The ERD is located in the ouptput_data folder as a  .svg file. 

Note: the ERD image file should be downloaded or viewed in Raw format for proper display.

Additional analyis/graphs are located in the Jupyter Notebook file. Graphs are also exported in .svg format to the output_data folder.
